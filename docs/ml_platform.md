# Applications

To support machine learning codes development, our users can deploy one or more private JupyterLab applications.

To encourage fair sharing these applications are time limited. We also ask users to requests only resources that they need.

Users can choose between two images: One with full anaconda (ivukotic/ml_platform:conda) and one with NVidia GPU and ROOT support (ivukotic/ml_platform:latest). The later has most of the ML packages (Tensorflow, Keras, ScikitLearn,...) preinstalled, and a small tutorial with example codes in /ML_platform_tests/tutorial.
For software additions and upgrades please contact ivukotic@uchicago.edu.
